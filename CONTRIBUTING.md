## C# Coding Style

1. Use four spaces of indentation, no tabs.

2. When editing existing files, keep new code and changes consistent with the style in the files.
Do not restyle files adopted from other repositories, they need to stay easily mergeable.

3. For new files follow settings in [.editorconfig](https://github.com/qbit86/misnomer/blob/master/.editorconfig) adopted from [corexf](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx) repository.
